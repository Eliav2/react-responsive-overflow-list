## Setup Instructions

1. **Enable GitHub Pages in your repository:**

   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to Settings â†’ Pages
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"

## Manual Deployment

If you want to test the deployment locally or manually:

```bash
# Build the library
pnpm run build

# Build the demo for production (with correct base path)
pnpm run demo:build:prod

# The built files will be in ./demo/dist/
```

## Configuration Details
